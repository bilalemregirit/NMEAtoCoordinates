This is readme file of NMEAtoCoordinates project of Bilal Emre Girit 

  i made this project for raspi but you can use it whereever you want, just need to edit for serial input part.
there is a slightly difference between values that came from NMEA sentences and real coordinates, this code
provides you to find your real coordinate values. code prints out two value like (latitude, longitude), if you copy 
this values to the Google Maps you can find your location presicely

 This code is only working in intersection ofNORTHERN HEPMİSPHERE and WEST SİDE OF PRİME MARİDİAN  !!!! 
 (i mean it only works with positive sign latidude and longitude values)
 
 (and sorry for turkish variable names, you can change them as you wish)

Necessary Libraries and Extensions:
1- Serial library for python
2- Raspi Serial configurations 
3- Time librart for phyton (optional)
